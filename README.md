# ApiSauna
An open-source project to create a sauna for bees - for hyperthermic treatments against varroa and other vermin.
The ApiSauna is designed to be controlled by an Arduino ATMega2560.

To compile, you'll need the following libraries:
* Adafruit Unified Sensor Library
* Adafruit DHT22 library
* OneWire library
* PID library
* LiquidCrystal library

NOTE: Do not use Arduino IDE above v1.6.11 as a bug in the gcc compiler will cause problems.
